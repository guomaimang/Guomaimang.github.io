# 命令行接口

## Command Line Interface

操作系统为用户执行各种程序。

A process is a program in execution. Process execution is done in a sequential fashion. 

In Unix/Linux, typing a command or a file name will cause the associated program to be executed. 

- A process is created for that purpose. 
- The program for that command or file will be loaded into the process. 
- Arguments will be passed to the program for execution. 

这由 "shell "处理，它成为执行用户命令的基本人类操作系统界面。
